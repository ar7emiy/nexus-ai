**NexusAI**

NexusAI is a platform designed to help students learn more efficiently with the aid of AI. Rather than providing direct answers, NexusAI focuses on helping students locate and understand the information they need from their own course materials.



**Key Features**

• AI-Enhanced Search: Utilizes Google Gemini to process and search through course content.

• Chatbot Interface: Students can ask questions and receive contextual snippets from their materials, which are highlighted and explained by the chatbot.

• Efficient Answer Location: Provides a way to pinpoint relevant information without giving direct answers, avoiding plagiarism issues.

• Custom Course Uploads: Students can upload and customize their own courses with materials like PDFs and video lectures. (In development)



**How it works**

Students or teachers upload materials to the platform, which are then stored in the cloud. When a student asks a question, the AI searches through the uploaded content and provides snippets that best match the query.


## Resource Breakdown:

### Cloud function codefiles

**gcp_nxs-function**

This GCP function processes user queries related to a lecture video, retrieving relevant snippets, generating summaries, and providing a signed URL for the video. It consists of two interacting files:

*   **main.py:** This file contains the core logic for handling user requests and orchestrating the processing pipeline.  The key function is `process_input`, which handles HTTP requests, extracts the user's query, calls `process_snippets` (explained below), loads processed data from GCS, generates a signed video URL, and returns the results.  Other important functions include `load_from_gcs`, `save_to_gcs`, `generate_signed_url`, `convert_to_seconds`, and `group_intervals`.

*   **retrieval_key.py:** This supporting file focuses on retrieving relevant video segments based on the user's query.  The crucial function here is `retrieve`, which loads video transcript data and pre-computed embeddings, embeds the user's query, calculates cosine similarity scores between the query embedding and the video segment embeddings, and returns the top 14 most similar segments.  This function is called by `process_snippets` in `main.py`. Other functions include `embed_text`, `load_data`, and `cosine_similarity`.

The interaction is as follows: `main.py` receives the user's query, and then uses `retrieval_key.py`'s `retrieve` function to get the most relevant snippets.  `main.py` then processes these snippets and generates summaries.

**gcp_pdf-retrieval-function**

This GCP function processes user queries related to a PDF document, retrieving relevant snippets, generating a relationship summary, and providing a signed URL for the PDF. It also comprises two files:

*   **main.py:** This file handles incoming HTTP requests, extracts the query, and orchestrates the PDF processing. The core function is `process_pdf_query`.  It loads PDF embeddings, calls `retrieve_pdf_snippets` (explained below), generates a relationship summary using `generate_relation_summary`, and returns the results along with a signed PDF URL. It also includes `embed_text`, `load_pdf_embeddings`, `cosine_similarity`, `preprocess_text`, and `generate_signed_url`.

*   **pdf_retrieval.py:** This file provides the functions for retrieving and summarizing relevant PDF content. The main function is `pdf_retrieval`, which takes a query, calls `retrieve_pdf_snippets` (explained below) to get relevant snippets, generates a signed URL for the PDF, and returns the results. It also includes `cosine_similarity`, `load_pdf_embeddings`, `generate_summary`, and `retrieve_pdf_snippets`.

The interaction between the files is as follows: `main.py`'s `process_pdf_query` calls `pdf_retrieval.py`'s `pdf_retrieval` method.  `pdf_retrieval` then uses `retrieve_pdf_snippets` to identify the most relevant snippets, which are then used by main.py to generate a response.  This response includes the snippets, a relationship summary (generated by `main.py`), and a link to the PDF.
